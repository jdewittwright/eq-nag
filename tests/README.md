# Tests

All of these use made-up data in a temporary folder. They never read or change
your real settings in `%APPDATA%\EQNag`. The end-to-end tests contact no trigger
websites, turn off Nag's update check, and mark the update notes as already
seen, so the Update Notes window (which loads from GitHub) doesn't open.
Nag's windows still open during a run, but without taking focus.

You need Node 22.22.3 or newer (or Node 24.15 or newer), which Angular 22
requires. The builds use the latest Node 22.

## Unit tests

```
npm test
```

These take a few seconds and need only `npm ci`. They cover saving and
recovering data, log backups, regex safety, the GINA search and share file
validation. Electron is replaced with a small stub, so they say nothing about
windows or overlays.

## End-to-end tests

These run a packaged build on Windows, on throwaway profiles. Build it, then
run the tests. It takes about 10 minutes, and windows will open while it runs:

```
npx ng build --configuration=production
npx electron-builder build --win dir --publish never
npm run test:e2e
```

To test another build, or to run only some groups:

```
node tests/e2e/overlay.test.cjs --exe "C:\path\to\EQ Nag.exe"
node tests/e2e/app.test.cjs --exe "C:\path\to\EQ Nag.exe" generators importFolders
```

| Group | Covers |
|---|---|
| `triggers` | Triggers firing, stored variables, hang protection (about 5 minutes) |
| `saving` | Moving the window, and quitting with a save pending |
| `settingsCleanup` | Removing the settings of removed features |
| `generators` | The DoT and buff generators and re-importing, with a fake spell |
| `damagedFile` | Restoring a damaged trigger file from its backup |
| `importFolders` | The import window's folder list |

`overlay.test.cjs` covers the overlay window: building overlays, showing timers,
and blocking script from shared triggers.

A run that stops early keeps its temporary `nag-e2e-*` folder and prints where it
is, because the app's logs are in there. You can delete it afterward.

Anything that depends on the main window's HTML is in `e2e/lib/ui.cjs`, so
upgrading Angular Material should mostly mean updating that one file.

## Check by hand

The tests check behavior, not appearance, and can't reach some things. Before
a release, and after upgrading Electron or Angular, check:

- **Overlays:** they look right and are transparent and click-through, including
  across multiple monitors and after a monitor turns off and on.
- **DPS meter:** live numbers on screen during real combat.
- **EQ Spell Resources:** one real DoT import and one real buff import,
  including a spell with an icon and a buff with an item effect.
- **GINA importer:** the window with GINA installed, and its "not found" message.
- **Sounds and speech:** alerts play out loud.
- **Copy to clipboard:** a trigger with a clipboard action copies its text.
- **A long session:** triggers keep working during a real raid, including buff
  timers that use cast times.
- **Installer:** installing over the previous version keeps your settings, and
  the app updates itself.
